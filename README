##Issue 1: if both binders point to two different eventhub in single cluster either one of them will be selected as group coordinator which is not correct which needs to be addressed.
##
#
#
#ISSUE 2:- if two eventhubs are not in cluster but dedicated ones then authorization issue
#
#OBSERVATION :- if two binder and configured to point localhost kafka instance they work as expected. The above given is a working example where one is eventhub and other is localhost

#so two different coordinators are selected.
